# InterviewGUI-Roblox
an interview gui i made for fun

# USAGE
Simply put your team name for :pm use when generating the questions.

/e is **optional** but I dont see why you wouldn't want it...

Auto copy is also an option to use however may lag a little bit if your spamming questions. Shouldn't be a problem most of the time. 

### **FOLLOW USAGE MESSAGE WHEN ENABLING AUTOCOPY** 

Simple integrated notepad included too

All question buttons layed out and labelled with output going to the 'Concatenated Text:' section.

Ending message and Greeting are both _customizable_ in **Config tab**

### Kick user is also integrated with options for **username** and **template for kick**

The kick message will be generated with previous settings applied (/e, autocopy)
